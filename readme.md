# Shutdown

## Description:
This was created by me as I am a very lazy in shutting down the PC and feel lazy in doing those clicks to first open the start menu then clicking the power icon on the side and then clicking shutdown button to shutdown the PC. I made this script to simplify this task and then just click the start key on the keyboard and then start typing 'shutdown' as typing shutdown is much easier than those boring clicks. Hence, when the shutdown.exe appears on the side startmenu, just press 'enter' and its done.

## How to compile
Compiling is easier, you have to open the directory and then in the cmd type
```
$ cargo build --release
```
And it will compile it for you.
